# App-Development-With-Swift
This repository was created to show the programs in the book "App Development With Swift" released on May, 24, 2017 by Apple.
The repository is divided by chapters, each chapter-folder has the practice exercises and the chapter project which is a more extense program. 

Keep in mind that this should not be a substitute to reading the actual book, but it is meant to be viewed as aid for someone stuck on a certain problem. 
Some practice exercises which don't involve coding for the most part are not part of this repository (for example, exercises like "About me" on chapter 3. 

The purpose of this is to dive into the swift programming language, get solid basis for app development, and show people the type of programs that you'll be able to do as you go along with this book.
