# App-Development-With-Swift
This repository was created to show the programs in the book "App Development With Swift" released on May, 24, 2017 by Apple.
The repository is divided by chapters, each chapter-folder has the practice exercises and the chapter project which is a more extense program. 

The purpose of this is to dive into the swift programming language, get solid basis for app development, and show people the type of programs that you'll be able to do as you go along with this book.
